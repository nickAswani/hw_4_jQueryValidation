In this assingment we were tasked with implementing a validation of the form inputs using jQuery Validation plugin(http://plugins.jquery.com)
I implemented the jQuery validation towards this exercise successfully.

My page passed both W3C Markup Validation Service for the html and W3C CSS validation Service for the css.
